Welcome to Inform 7 Examples, a [group](https://github.com/orgs/I7-Examples/people) and [website](https://i7-examples.github.io/) for Inform 7 enthusiasts.

Back in the era of I7 Build 6G60, there was [a page on inform7.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20150407084231/http://inform7.com:80/learn/complete-examples/) which presented six games along with their source text. These "standard examples" provided a useful introduction to the features and capabilities of Inform 7.

The same page on inform7.com provided [a link to ifdb.tads.org](https://ifdb.tads.org/search?searchfor=tag:I7%20source%20available) which searched for games written in Inform 7 for which the complete source text had been released. Many of these "community examples" were also of great interest.

However, Inform 7 has moved on since these examples were written. The source text no longer compiles and this limits their usefulness. I think it would be interesting and instructive to update these games so that they compile when using the latest version of Inform 7.

Anyone can join this group. Please [ask for an invitation](https://github.com/I7-Examples/.github/issues/new) if you would like to contribute.
